    "\n",
    "*Does higher education truly lead to higher incomes? Let's delve into the correlation between education levels and the likelihood of earning more than $50K per year.*\n",
    "\n",
    "To investigate the relationship between education levels and earning potential, we embarked on a deep analysis of the Census Income data. We grouped individuals according to their education levels and calculated the percentage of people within each group earning more than $50K per year. To make the data more comprehensible, we created a mapping of education levels in numerical order and sorted the income percentages accordingly. The results were then visualized in a bar chart.\n",

    "Our findings paint a clear picture: there is a strong correlation between education level and earning potential. As the level of education increases, so does the likelihood of earning more than $50K per year. This trend suggests that investing in higher education can significantly improve an individual's chances of earning a higher income.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it's essential to consider other factors that may also influence income levels, such as occupation, work hours per week, and native country. For instance, our analysis revealed that individuals with a Doctorate or Professional school degree have a significantly higher likelihood of earning more than $50K per year (over 50%) compared to those with lower education levels. In contrast, individuals with less than a high school education have a much lower likelihood of earning more than $50K per year (less than 5%).\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, the bar chart demonstrates a clear trend where the percentage of individuals earning more than $50K per year generally increases as the education level increases. This suggests that pursuing higher education can have a considerable impact on an individual's income. However, it's crucial to weigh other factors, such as occupation and work hours per week, when making decisions about education and career paths.\n"

    "\n",
    "*Does age play a role in determining income levels? Let's uncover if older individuals tend to earn more than younger individuals or if there's a specific age range where income peaks.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Our findings unveil that the relationship between age and income levels follows a non-linear trend. To better understand this relationship, we first analyzed the age group distribution in the Census Income dataset. We found that the distribution is skewed towards younger age groups, with a higher frequency of individuals in their 20s and 30s.\n",

    "<div align=\"center\"><b> Figure 3 Income Levels Based on Age and Age Group Distribution </b></div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we explored the percentage of individuals earning more than $50K per year across different age groups. Our results show that income levels tend to rise with age during the early 20s to mid-50s, peak around the mid-50s, and then decline as individuals approach retirement age. This pattern suggests that income levels generally increase as individuals gain more experience and advance in their careers, but they may decline as people reduce their working hours or retire altogether.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the relationship between age and income levels can help inform policy decisions related to employment, retirement, and social welfare. For instance, policies that encourage older workers to stay in the workforce longer or provide training opportunities for mid-career professionals could help maintain higher income levels for a more extended period. On the other hand, policies that support younger workers in building their skills and advancing in their careers could help them achieve higher incomes earlier in their working lives.\n"

    "\n",
    "*Do gender and race contribute to income inequality? Let's delve into how these factors influence the probability of earning more than $50K per year.*\n",
    "\n",
    "We began our analysis by examining the Census Income data, considering both gender and race categories. Our goal was to uncover any disparities that might exist between different groups when it comes to earning more than $50K per year. To visualize our findings, we created a combined bar plot that showcased the income percentages across various gender and racial groups.\n",

    "Our findings reveal a striking income gap between genders within each racial group. Males consistently have a higher percentage of individuals earning more than $50K per year compared to females. This disparity highlights the influence of gender on income levels and calls attention to the need for policies that address gender-based income inequality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, our analysis shows that the Asian-Pac-Islander and White racial groups have a higher percentage of individuals earning more than $50K per year compared to other racial groups, such as Black, Amer-Indian-Eskimo, and Other. This difference suggests that race also plays a role in determining the likelihood of earning a higher income.\n",

    "<div align=\"center\"><b> Figure 4b Patterns of Work Hours, Education Levels, and Capital Gains </b></div>\n",
    "\n",
    "The earnings gap between females and males could be attributed to several factors, including higher work hours and education levels among males compared to females. Additionally, potential sexism in the workplace and women's increased involvement in family responsibilities may also contribute to this disparity. Interestingly, our findings show that there is no significant difference in capital gains between females and males, suggesting that financial situations may not play a major role in this earnings gap.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the impact of gender and race on income levels can help policymakers and businesses develop targeted strategies to address income inequality and promote equal opportunities for all. For instance, policies promoting equal pay for equal work, diversity and inclusion initiatives, and skills training for underrepresented groups could help bridge the income gap and create a more equitable workforce.\n"

It is similar for European Americans.  In contrast, people from central America have a relatively lower education level (about 8.5) and shorter working hours (less than 39 hours per week), which may cause their earning potentially lower. The similar situation occurs on South America people but a bit better than Central America. It is notable that people from North America have a lower education level (about 8.5) but a longer working hours (about 41 hours per week). Mexico’s underdevelopment lowers North America’s education and income averages.\n",

    "After applying clustering algorithms, we discovered several distinct income groups, each with unique characteristics. The key features defining these groups included:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Age: Younger individuals were more likely to be in lower-income groups, while older individuals were more prevalent in higher-income groups.\n",
    "2. Education: Higher levels of education were associated with a greater likelihood of belonging to a higher-income group.\n",
    "3. Occupation: Certain occupations, such as \"Exec-managerial\" and \"Prof-specialty\", were more prevalent in higher-income groups, while others, like \"Handlers-cleaners\" and \"Farming-fishing\", were more common in lower-income groups.\n",

By examining the interplay of age, education, occupation, work hours, gender, race, and native country, we have identified key characteristics that define distinct income groups and affect an individual's likelihood of earning more than $50K per year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on our findings, we offer the following practical recommendations to individuals, policymakers, and employers:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Invest in education and skill development**: Pursuing higher education and acquiring relevant skills can significantly increase an individual's earning potential. Policymakers and employers should support initiatives that provide equal access to education and skill-building opportunities, especially for underrepresented groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Promote diversity and inclusion in the workplace**: Addressing gender and racial disparities in income levels requires concerted efforts from both policymakers and employers. Implementing policies that ensure equal pay for equal work and fostering a diverse and inclusive work environment can help bridge the income gap.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Encourage lifelong learning and career advancement**: As age and work experience play a crucial role in determining income levels, individuals should seek opportunities for continuous learning and professional growth. Employers and policymakers can support this by offering training programs and incentives for career development, particularly for mid-career professionals.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Support work-life balance**: While working longer hours may lead to higher incomes, it's essential to consider the impact of work hours on overall well-being. Employers should encourage a healthy work-life balance by providing flexible work arrangements and promoting a supportive work culture.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Address income disparities based on native country**: Policymakers and educators should focus on providing equal opportunities for immigrants from underrepresented countries, helping them bridge the income gap through targeted education, skill development, and cultural integration initiatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "By implementing these recommendations, we can work towards creating a more equitable workforce and fostering equal opportunities for all, regardless of age, education, occupation, work hours, gender, race, or native country. Through a collaborative effort among individuals, policymakers, and employers, we can address income inequality and promote economic growth for everyone.\n",
    "\n",

    "1. **Dataset limitations**: The Census Income dataset, though comprehensive, might not capture all relevant factors that influence income levels. Additionally, the data is limited to the United States and may not be directly applicable to other countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Causality**: Our study identified correlations between various factors and income levels, but it's essential to note that correlation does not imply causation. Further research is needed to establish causal relationships between these factors and income levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Model assumptions**: The clustering and classification techniques used in our analysis rely on certain assumptions and simplifications, which may not always hold true in real-world scenarios. The results should be interpreted with caution, keeping these assumptions in mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Generalizability**: Our findings are based on a specific dataset, and the results may not be generalizable to all populations or time periods. Future studies could benefit from analyzing more recent data or exploring income disparities in different countries or regions.\n",
